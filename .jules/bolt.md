## 2024-05-14 - Batch Schema Extraction
**Learning:** For database schema extraction, querying columns table-by-table in a loop can cause an N+1 query problem, making it slow. The MySQL driver was optimized to use a batched query (`IN (?, ?, ...)`), but `sqlserver.ts` is still using a loop.
**Action:** Optimize schema extraction in `sqlserver.ts` by using a single batched query to get columns for all tables, replacing the `for` loop over `tables` that executes a query for each.
## 2026-05-23 - SQL Server Schema Batch Optimization
**Learning:** When querying INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS, chunking IN (@table...) parameters to respect SQL Server's 2100 limit is unnecessary and inefficient. It's better to avoid passing the list of tables entirely by doing a JOIN with INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES and applying the same filter directly.
**Action:** Remove the chunking loop and use a JOIN to extract metadata for all relevant tables in a single DB query, simplifying logic and reducing compilation and network overhead.
## 2026-05-25 - DynamoDB Schema Parallel Extraction
**Learning:** Sequential network calls per table in DynamoDB schema extraction cause high latency (O(N) network round-trips). Unlike relational DBs that can JOIN metadata tables, DynamoDB requires one HTTP request per table.
**Action:** Optimize DynamoDB schema extraction by sending `DescribeTableCommand` requests concurrently using `Promise.all`, but chunked (e.g. 10 at a time) to prevent AWS API throttling.
## 2024-06-25 - Avoid array sort for Top-K in hot paths
**Learning:** V8 engine sorting (`[...arr].sort()`) is surprisingly slow and blocks the event loop for thousands of records when fetching Top-K elements (e.g. usage statistics). It scales at O(N log N) when O(N) is sufficient for a fixed K.
**Action:** When gathering top elements from a large data array in this codebase, manually track the top items in a single O(N) pass rather than sorting a full copy.
## 2024-05-18 - Avoid Set and Sort for sequentially populated index trackers
**Learning:** Using a `Set` to track indices during sequential iteration (like finding boundary positions in a string), and later converting to an Array and sorting it (`Array.from(set).sort()`), is an anti-pattern. Because sequential loops naturally produce monotonically increasing indices, the resulting array is already sorted. The O(N log N) sorting overhead and Set conversion adds unnecessary performance cost in hot paths like SQL statement parsing.
**Action:** When tracking index positions during sequential iteration, use standard arrays (`number[]`) populated via `.push()` instead of `Set`s that require subsequent conversion and sorting.
